# This file demonstrates the basics of tuples in Python.
# Tuples are immutable ordered collections.

# Define a tuple of numbers
numbers = (1, 4, 8)

# Access and print elements by index
print(numbers[0])  # Print first element: 1
print(numbers[1])  # Print second element: 4
print(numbers[2])  # Print third element: 8

# Define a single-element tuple (comma is required to distinguish from parentheses)
single = (2,)
