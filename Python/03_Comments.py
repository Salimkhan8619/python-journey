# File: 03_Comments.py
# This file demonstrates the use of comments in Python programming.
# Comments are lines in the code that are ignored by the Python interpreter.
# They are used to explain what the code does, making it easier to understand and maintain.
# There are two main types of comments in Python: single-line and multiline.

# Single-line comments start with the # symbol and continue to the end of the line.
# This will print hello World

# The line above is a single-line comment explaining the code below.

'''This is a multiline comment'''
# Multiline comments are created using triple quotes (''' or """).
# They can span multiple lines and are often used for longer explanations or documentation.
# Note: Technically, this is a string literal, but when not assigned to a variable, it acts like a comment.

print("Hello World")  # This line executes the print function to display "Hello World" on the screen.
